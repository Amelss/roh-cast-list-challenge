- I completed the challenge using React and called the API using Fetch
- I ran into some issues seeing the API call at first because of CORS. So I downloaded a Google Chrome extension which bypassed the CORS error message.
- I had slight issues accessing the title and shortDescription object through object destructing so I had to set state to attribute instead. Ideally I would have like to just call one object and access the nested objects within it.
- Added some very basic styling to the project
